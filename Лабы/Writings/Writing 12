After the party, Amanda felt very pleased with herself. All of the guests have slept peacefully on the second floor of this house.
Yesterday was the first day of July and Amanda wanted to spend it with her friends. The company of five friends has packed up and drove out of town to rest.
Swimming in the river, delicious fried food, and the hot sun did not leave the young people unhappy.
The weather was fine but Amanda's heart was restless. Is too quiet. 
Even the usual chirping of crickets was not heard at this early morning hour.
Amanda got up and walked to the edge of the veranda, peering into the shadow moving by the fence.
"Who could it be?" - thought Amanda.
"Hey, there. You need some kind of help?" - Amanda asks in a worried voice.
Quiet.
Amanda came down from the beautiful veranda and went to the fence.
An elderly man in a dirty white T-shirt, torn shorts, and one of flip flop stood behind the fence.
He looked strange.
Disheveled hair looked in different directions and close the man's eyes, all the skin was covered in dust, and a trickle of blood was running down his hand.
An agitated girl, noticing the blood, hurried to open the gate and walk up to the unfamiliar man.
This was Amanda's biggest and at the same time last mistake in her life.
Before that, the motionless old man quickly grabbed the girl by the hand and pulled her to him.
Amanda got scared and tried to pull away, but he had a death grip.
At the last moment, the girl saw his eyes, lifeless, red, pain-filled eyes.
These eyes are all that the girl saw before her death.
-Content not for teacher mind-
The man threw the disfigured girl to the ground and went into the house, growling loudly ...
