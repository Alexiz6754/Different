 
Hello, Rebecca
I hope you're well. I'm writing a quick message to say I'm really sorry to this happened.
I really wanted to go to your birthday party but I've been really busy organizing events in my club. 
In the spring, we constantly have to work hard.

I'm apologizing and suggest you meet at the beginning of next month when the events are ended we may get together with friends at my home and get a good time.
We'll eat delicious food and watching the new Hotel Transylvania (check out this cartoon).  
I'll do everything to feel you good.

We’ll be in touch soon.
All the best,


Седымов А.А.
