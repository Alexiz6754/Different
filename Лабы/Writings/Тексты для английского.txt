Расскажите про важное на ваш взгляд изобретение

I think the most important invention in our lives is the internet.

Because of the internet, we may get in touch in a long-distance, can send a message to our foreign friend or call it.

Now the internet is part of our lives and now we don't imagine life without the internet.


Используешь ли ты пиратский контент

Of course, I use illegal content in my life.
When I was younger I'm always used illegal content like different programs and games.

But when I entered ITMO I began trying to use official content like Office, because IT gives ways for that.

Now I'm only watching illegal movies and cartoons because I'm a (*hicca) and I won't going to the cinema with myself.

Приведи пример и опиши странные взаимоотношения с родственниками

As an example of strange relationships, I can give a Harry Potter novel.

In that novel, Harry lives without his parents and all of his relatives are Dursls.

I believe that they love Harry but they hide that love in the deep of their hearts.

Опиши когда, как и за что ты извинялся.

I really don't love to apologize, but sometimes if I behave silly, I need to apologize to a friend or a teacher, or a different person.

That story about that.
When I was younger and walked to a child's garden, I broke my mother's favorite cup and hid fragments behind the sofa.

Of course, it didn't go unnoticed and my parents have scolded me for a long time.
To reduce their's anger I had gone to apologize.

After that they forgave me and I became a little bit clever.
Now I'm hiding things in the cupboard.
