 
TELL US ABOUT YOU...

Hello everyone, my name is Alex Sedymov and I'm from Omsk. Omsk is a large town in Siberia. 
But now I have been living in Saint-Petersburg for almost one year and study at the ITMO University. 
I have entered that university because I want to become a good programmer in the future.

HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THIS COURSE?

I am upset that not all subjects in the course are useful and interesting, but I do not think the course is bad.
I'm always really looking forward to learning about the profile disciplines of my specialty.


WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN YOU'RE NOT STUDYING

When I'm not studying I have the training and playing table games. 
Especially I love playing the sports Mafia. 
The sports Mafia is a game where you need to good speaking and well-listening. 
I think there's the best opportunity to spend time!
