In my opinion, the most important invention has been cars. 
The first car was invented in 1885, in Germany by Karl Benz. 
I think cars are the most important invention because now we might travel a large distance and doing hard work thanks to this invention.

Of course, we have a reverse side of the coin. 
Cars very pollute the atmosphere and because of them occur different accident but it does not compare with the benefits they bring. 
Cars are essential to our lives, and we can't argue with that.
Our life was very changed when cars entered into the use of people. 
I'm confident that many workers still cannot imagine their work without a car since it alone both plows the land (I mean a tractor) and transporting huge loads.

Because of the invention of cars, all of our lives have changed and I hope that it has changed for to better.
