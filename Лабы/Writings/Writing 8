I have read many books, but now I want to tell you about "The Boy and the Darkness" written by Sergey Lukyanenko.

In my mind, this book is quite interesting.
The story begins in our time in an ordinary apartment in Moscow but then flows into a dark fantasy in which people live without seeing the sun all of their lives. The main characters are Danka, Len, and Kitten try to bring light to people living there while they are hindered by the Flying people who are trying to give the world to darkness. Of course, the main theme of the book shows the classic struggle between good and evil. But it is obvious that the author puts something more into the work.

I couldn't put this book down until I got to the end. I can recommend it to teenagers.  Because the most important things described are friendship and betrayal, growing up, and self-knowledge. I  believe that the problems described here will be close and useful to them.
